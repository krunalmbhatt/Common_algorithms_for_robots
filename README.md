# All_Algo ROS Package

This package provides implementations of various algorithms with proper visualization. 
## Prerequisites

- ROS (Robot Operating System) installed on your system.
- A map file in `.yaml` format.

## Installation

1. Create a catkin workspace if you don't have one:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
    cd ~/catkin_ws/
    catkin_make
    source devel/setup.bash
    ```

2. Clone the `all_algo` package into the `src` directory of your workspace:
    ```bash
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/all_algo.git
    ```

3. Download the map files and place them in the `maps` directory of the package:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src/all_algo/maps
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src/all_algo/maps
    # Download map.pgm and map.yaml files into this directory
    ```

4. Build the package:
    ```bash
    cd ~/catkin_ws/
    catkin_make
    ```

## Usage

1. Source your workspace:
    ```bash
    source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
    ```

2. Launch the motion planning nodes:
    ```bash
    roslaunch all_algo motion_planning.launch
    ```

## Nodes

### A* (A Star)
- Node: `motion_planning_a_star`
- Source: `src/a_star.cpp`

### RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree)
- Node: `motion_planning_rrt`
- Source: `src/rrt.cpp`

### RRT* (RRT Star)
- Node: `motion_planning_rrt_star`
- Source: `src/rrt_star.cpp`

### PRM (Probabilistic Roadmap)
- Node: `motion_planning_prm`
- Source: `src/prm.cpp`

Each algorithm node will subscribe to the map topic and perform the respective motion planning algorithm to find a path from the start to the goal while avoiding obstacles.

## Visualization

The paths generated by the motion planning algorithms will be visualized in RViz. Make sure to add the necessary displays in RViz to visualize the `/planned_path` topic.
